# EDA-for-NYC-Motor-Vehicle-Crashes

This repository contains an exploratory project using data from the city of new york on motor vehicle crashes.

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with data cleaning and processing, and some exploratory analysis to identify trends. 
Main question: \
What city has the most fatal crashes, and what is the leading cause of these crashes? 

The results show that Brooklyn had the highest number of crashes followed by Queens. I normalized it to the population per borough, and plotted it as total killed per 100k residents.
