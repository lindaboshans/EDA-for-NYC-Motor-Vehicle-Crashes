# EDA-for-NYC-Motor-Vehicle-Crashes

This repository hosts an investigative project that examines motor vehicle crash data provided by the City of New York. Through this exploration, my primary aim was to enhance my skills in data cleaning, processing, and to conduct exploratory analysis to unearth underlying trends, particularly focusing on identifying the borough with the highest rate of fatal crashes and the predominant causes behind these tragic incidents.

After a thorough analysis, it was determined that Brooklyn experienced the most significant number of crashes, closely followed by Queens. To offer a more nuanced perspective, I normalized these figures against the population of each borough, presenting the findings as the total number of fatalities per 100,000 residents. This approach not only sheds light on the severity of motor vehicle collisions across different boroughs but also highlights the critical need for targeted safety measures.
